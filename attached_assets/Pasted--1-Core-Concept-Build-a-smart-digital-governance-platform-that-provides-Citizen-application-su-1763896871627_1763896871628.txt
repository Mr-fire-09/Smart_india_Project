🔹 1. Core Concept

Build a smart digital governance platform that provides:

Citizen application submission

AI-based workflow monitoring

Delay detection

Real-time notifications

OTP-based feedback system

Application tracking with unique ID

Auto-approval after 30 days

Public rating system

Document hash storage on blockchain (simulation allowed)

Official dashboard

🔹 2. Functional Requirements

Include the following modules:

Citizen Side

Login / Register

Submit an application

Track application with unique ID

Receive alerts on approval/delay

Submit feedback + OTP verification

View status history

Official Side

Assign/Accept applications

Update status

View citizen feedback

Performance dashboard

Admin Panel

View all applications

Monitor delays

Configure auto-approval settings

Manage officials

🔹 3. AI Integration

Simulate AI features with Spring Boot services:

AI workflow engine that monitors every application

Detect inactivity or delays

Trigger alerts to officials + users

Recommend bottleneck points

Auto-approve after 30 days

Analyze feedback to generate performance score

(AI can be rule-based, ML is optional.)

🔹 4. Technical Architecture

Backend (Spring Boot):

RESTful APIs

Controllers: User, Application, Feedback, OTP, Admin

Services: AI Engine, Notification, Blockchain, Delay Detector

Entities: User, Application, Feedback, Official, OTPRecord, HashRecord

Security using Spring Security + JWT

MySQL for database

Redis (Optional) for caching + queueing AI tasks

Frontend:

HTML5

CSS3

JavaScript (Vanilla)

Responsive UI (Govt theme)

Blockchain (Simulation allowed):

Store hash of approved application documents

Use a private blockchain simulation or local hash chain

🔹 5. System Flow (Required Output)

Ask the AI to generate:

User submits application

Application stored in MySQL

Assigned to official

AI monitors delays

Alerts triggered

Official updates progress

Citizen gives rating

OTP verification

Hash stored on blockchain (simulated)

Dashboard shows insights

🔹 6. Deliverables Needed

Ask AI to generate:

Full project folder structure

Spring Boot backend code (working condition)

MySQL database ER diagram

APIs documentation

Frontend pages (HTML/CSS/JS)

AI engine logic

Blockchain simulation code

Deployment instructions

GitHub-ready README.md (aesthetic + animated badges)

🔹 7. Tone & Output Style

Generate:

Clean, production-level backend

Well-commented code

Attractive UI

Professional architecture diagram

100% working sample code

Perfect for SIH-level project submission
